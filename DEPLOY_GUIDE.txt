# TRACLER — CLEAN DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
# Supabase (DB) + Railway (Backend) + Vercel (Frontend)
# =====================================================

## OVERVIEW
You will:
1. Create a new GitHub repo with the clean project files
2. Set up Supabase (free Postgres database)
3. Deploy backend to Railway
4. Deploy frontend to Vercel

Total time: ~15 minutes

---

## STEP 1 — CREATE NEW GITHUB REPO

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name it: tracler
3. Set to Public (or Private — either works)
4. Do NOT check "Add README" or anything else
5. Click "Create repository"
6. GitHub will show you a page with commands — leave it open

Now in Command Prompt, pick a fresh folder (e.g. your Desktop):

    cd C:\Users\tyran\Desktop
    mkdir tracler
    cd tracler

Extract the zip I gave you into this folder so it looks like:

    C:\Users\tyran\Desktop\tracler\
        server\
            server.js
            package.json
        client\
            src\
                App.jsx
                main.jsx
            index.html
            package.json
            vite.config.js
        package.json
        .gitignore

Then run:

    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tracler.git
    git push -u origin main

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.

## STEP 2 — SET UP SUPABASE (Free Database)

1. Go to https://supabase.com → Sign up with GitHub
2. Click "New Project"
   - Name: tracler
   - Database Password: make something strong, SAVE IT
   - Region: pick closest to your team
3. Wait ~2 minutes for it to provision
4. Go to: Settings → Database → Connection string → URI tab
5. Copy the URI — it looks like:
   postgresql://postgres:YOURPASSWORD@db.xxxxxxxxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres

⚠️  Replace [YOUR-PASSWORD] in the URI with your actual password

✅ SAVE THIS URI — you need it in Step 3

---

## STEP 3 — DEPLOY BACKEND TO RAILWAY

1. Go to https://railway.app → Sign in with GitHub
2. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your tracler repo
4. Once it appears, click the service card
5. Go to "Variables" tab → click "+ New Variable":
   - Key:   DATABASE_URL
   - Value: (paste your Supabase URI from Step 2)
6. Go to "Settings" → "Networking" → click "Generate Domain"
7. Copy your Railway URL — looks like:
   https://tracler-production.up.railway.app

✅ SAVE THIS URL — you need it in Step 4

Test it works — open this in your browser:
   https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL/health
You should see: Tracler backend running ✅

---

## STEP 4 — DEPLOY FRONTEND TO VERCEL

1. Go to https://vercel.com → Sign in with GitHub
2. Click "Add New Project" → Import your tracler repo
3. IMPORTANT: Set Root Directory to "client"
   (click "Edit" next to root directory and type: client)
4. Expand "Environment Variables" and add:
   - Key:   VITE_API_URL
   - Value: https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL (from Step 3, no trailing slash)
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Wait ~1 minute — Vercel gives you a public URL like:
   https://tracler.vercel.app

---

## STEP 5 — TEST EVERYTHING

1. Open your Vercel URL
2. Add a player — if it saves ✅
3. Refresh the page — if the player is still there ✅
4. Send the URL to a teammate — if they see the same data ✅

You're live!

## HOW TO UPDATE THE APP GOING FORWARD

Whenever you make changes, just run:

    git add .
    git commit -m "describe your change"
    git push

Railway and Vercel both auto-redeploy on every push. That's it.
