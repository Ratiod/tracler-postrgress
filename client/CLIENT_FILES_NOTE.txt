# Client Files

**IMPORTANT**: Copy your existing client files here!

Your existing project should have:
- `index.html`
- `package.json`
- `vite.config.js`
- `src/App.jsx`
- `src/main.jsx`

Copy all of these from your current `bztracker` or `ticra` folder into this `client` directory.

The only thing that changed is the backend - your frontend code stays the same. Just make sure the API calls in `App.jsx` point to `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` which will be set as an environment variable on Render.
